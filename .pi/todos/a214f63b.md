# Next Slide Preview (Follow-up)

Implemented next slide preview in the presenter.

## Implementation
- Added next preview iframe and layout updates to presenter view.
- Uses `slides` order from `presenter.json` or deck API `getSlideList()` when available.
- Shows placeholders for missing order/last slide.
- Added demo support for relative hash resolution and config.

## Notes
- Relative hash preview is gated by config via `preview.relativeHash`.
