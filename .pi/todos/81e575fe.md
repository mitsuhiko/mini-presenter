# Relative Hash Navigation (~next/~prev)

Introduce a minimal opt-in contract for slide systems to resolve relative navigation in the hash. Use `~next` / `~prev` suffixes so the presentation can resolve to the actual next/previous state (including build steps).

## Rationale

- Avoids needing full slide list / API.
- Lets next-slide preview resolve to the real next state via the deck itself.
- `~` is unlikely to conflict with existing hash semantics.

## Proposed Contract

- `#<hash>~next` → resolve to next logical state
- `#<hash>~prev` → resolve to previous logical state
- Optional: `#~next` / `#~prev` → resolve from current state

## Implementation Notes

- Presenter preview uses `#<current>~next` when enabled.
- The deck is responsible for rewriting the hash (e.g., `history.replaceState`).
- Presenter can read back the resolved hash (same-origin iframe) to display the target.

## Depends on
- TODO-90eed9c7 (Config file support / opt-in)
- TODO-a214f63b (Next slide preview)
