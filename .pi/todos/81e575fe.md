# Relative Hash Navigation (~next/~prev)

Implemented opt-in relative hash support for previews.

## Implementation
- Presenter uses `#<hash>~next` when `preview.relativeHash` is enabled.
- Demo deck resolves `~next`/`~prev` by updating the hash to the next state.
- Documented the contract in README.
